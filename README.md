# StuartLab_2017
This is intended as a distillation and improvement to StuartLabOscilloscopeInterface2, StuartLabOrdFunctions, and StuartLabHistPlotLib

This repository will not be able to do things that those other repositories can do.
In fact, this repository will probably have less functionality overall.
The principle advantage with this is that it will be more user friendly, better documented, and more modular.
