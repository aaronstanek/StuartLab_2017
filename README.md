This software makes plots using data in the Oscilloscope Readout Data Format (.ord.json files)

This software is capable of producing histograms showing the energy spectrum of the observed particles.
For runs with data from multiple channels, it can generate 2D heatmaps which show the energy spectra and coincidence.
And for both the 1D and 2D cases, it includes features for making cuts, calibrating energies and removing background events.

For usage examples, please read example.py
